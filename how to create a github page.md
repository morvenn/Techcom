GitHub page - it's easy!

# Let's start

Here are the step by step instructions:

1. Create a new repository. If you don't remember how to do it, look [here](how%20to%20work%20with%20github).
2. Name your repository according to the scheme my_username.github.io. Set visibility to public.

   ![example](repository_name.jpg)   

3. You can click the "Add a README file" checkbox if you wish.
4. Click on "Create repository" and add the index.html or index.md file to the repository
5. And there you have it - it works! Admittedly, the page is empty for now, but we will deal with that in the next steps :-)
