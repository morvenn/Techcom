Hi, this is my page about working with the basic tools:
* Markdown
* Visual Studio Code
* Git & GitHub & GitHub Desktop
* GitHub pages
* GitHub page from any repository

**Important:** I didn't try to write this content as a typical documentation.
I rather imagined that I was explaining issues from our classes to a colleague.

**Enjoy!**
