How to start your adventure with git & GitHub
======
# The beginning

To start working with git*, you first need to create an account on GitHub. This is similar to setting up a profile in any social media channel. Just go to:
(https://github.com/)

Then in the upper right corner click on Sign up. 

Fill in all the fields one by one (including the one that checks you are not a robot) and click on Create Account.

Congratulations, you already have a GitHub account! Now you can add a profile picture, or start following your friends. At this stage it's not much different from Facebook :-) But GitHub is not Facebook - its most important purpose is to store the pieces of your code, to share it and to work on it with other people.

# Git vs GitHub

Important: learn to distinguish between GitHub and git. Git is: 

* a kind of tool
* a version control system for code
* a way of working
* a way of thinking/operating/whatever you called it

...while GitHub is a place where you can upload and store the code using git commands. You can also use a dedicated program, for example GitHub Desktop.

# GitHub Desktop

You can download the installation version of the program from here:
(https://desktop.github.com/)
Download it, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. 

After the first run you will see the screen with welcome information. 

Now you can create a GitHub account if you haven't already done so, but you can also sign in to your GitHub account if you already have one.

When you click sign in, it launches a page in your default browser where you simply click the "Authorize desktop" button. This logs you into your GitHub account in the program. The program then asks you to set up a name and email for future code work. You click continue. You will be asked if you agree to periodically submitting usage stats for the program (which is optional). Done!
You are now on the "Let's get started" screen. At this point you can already start working with git, ie:

* create a tutorial repository
* clone a repository from the Internet
* create a new repository on your hard drive
* add an existing from your hard drive

# But what is repository?

     Repository:
        |     |
     Local  Remote
     /        \
    /          \
    my disc    my GitHub
  		|
  		|
    send it using git
          OR
    send it using GitHub Desktop
          OR
    send it using VS Code
