Using markdown is very easy. Let's start from the very beginning: a title of the document. Create it by inserting a few characters like this: =

This is title
========================
Here the note really starts. As you can see, using markdown is as simple as that. 

Here we have an introduction. The introduction is short and not very sophisticated. And here's the way you create an *italics*.

Here we have **bold** in our introduction.

# And this is chapter 1 

The chapter title is created by inserting the # sign and a space.

## 1.1. Let's start the note

You can create a subchapter by inserting two # characters.

* point - * sign and a space
* point - and so on

1. Here we continue writing
2. And again

And here's a clever quote.
>Clever quote.  

End of the quote. Let's check something else!

`x=2`

Between such characters ` you put notations of mathematical operations, formulas, etc.

A table - see how to do it!
